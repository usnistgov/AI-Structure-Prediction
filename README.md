your README should contain:

1. Software or Data description
   - This repository contains the results of AI-predictions for multiple RNA and DNA structures, denoted by their corresponding PDB IDs. It additionally contains the Fortran code written to perform ensemble residual dipolar coupling evaluation, and includes a test case for vlaidation of the code. 
   - "AllPredictedModels.zip" contains 285 cif formatted files, corresponding to the AI-predicted structures denoted in the manuscript.
   - "RDCfits_CodeExample_2KOC.zip" contains the SVD fit code and RDC prediction software, written in F90, as well as files from PDB ID 2KOC to use as a testcase.
   - "RDCfits_EnsembleCoordinates.zip" contains the overlapped five AI-predicted structure models for each PDB ID used for predicting RDCs.
   - "RDCfits_FitResults.zip" contains the raw results from ensemble fits of experimental RDCs to AI-predicted structures.
